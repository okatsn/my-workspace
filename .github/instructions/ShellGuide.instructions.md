When you are asked to build a shell script, stick to the goal of simplicity and maintainability, because any of the script you are asked to build is for my personal use.
This means complicated/nested conditional blocks should be avoided; nested loop should be avoided; no need for dedicated user-friendly interface (if it could add extra difficulties in maintaining).
