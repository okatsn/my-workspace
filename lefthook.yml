pre-commit:
  commands:
    dockerbuild:
      glob: "my-mini-explorer/Dockerfile"
      run: . ./docker_build_and_push.sh
    testing:
      run: echo "Hello these are all {staged_files}"

# - Use `lefthook run pre-commit` to manually run pre-commit commands.
# - `glob` is the filter for the name of staged files, that the command will be invoked only when the matched `staged_files` is not empty. See https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook?tab=readme-ov-file#glob-and-regexp-filters
# - VSCode commit will not trigger the lefthook actions.
