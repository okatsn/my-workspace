pre-commit:
  commands:
    dockerbuild:
      glob: "*Dockerfile"
      # run: . ./docker_build_and_push.sh
      run: . ./echo_hello.sh
    testing:
      glob: "*.sh"
      run: echo "Hello these are all {staged_files}"
# - Use `lefthook run pre-commit` to run on demand.
# - `glob` is the filter for the name of staged files, that the command will be invoked only when the matched `staged_files` is not empty.
